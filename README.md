Challenges we ran into
1.Metamask interaction with contracts, the difference between call(), and send(), these took some time to understand. All these days I was experienced with signing my own transaction with private keys in code.

2.This was our first blockchain project, understanding all the about NFT'S, and everything around this was quite hard compared to normal web3 projects.

3.IPFS integration in smart contracts, the docs are not very approachable for a beginner. Watched a ton of tutorials.

4.Spheron did take some time to get used to deploy our project, asking mentors for help and getting solutions had a great learning experience.
